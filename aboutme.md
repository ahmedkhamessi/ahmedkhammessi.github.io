I am a cloud enthusiast with a main focus on Cloud Native Technologies, which will be the main topic that I will be blogging here..
I started early with Software Engineering so automation and scripting tasks just come naturally to my mind, but also it helps me getting concrete when thinking about architecture and the different use case scenarios.

Opinions are mine!
