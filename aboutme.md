I am a cloud enthousiastique with a main focus on Cloud Native Technologies which will be the main topic
that i will be blogging here..  
I started early with Software Engineering so automation and scripting tasks just comes naturaly to my mind
but also it helps me getting concrete when thinking about architecture and the different use case scenarios.
