Let's take it over where we left in the previous [article](https://ahmedkhamessi.com/2020-10-07-Service-Mesh-202/), We have familiarized with the **MeshPolicy** and **Policy** concepts in the Istio world. The system reached the inter-services security standards by implementing mutual TLS. However, There were limitations to the setup where such as **Authorization** aspect but  fortunately Istio comes with a baked in **AuthorizationPolicy** .

## AuthorizationPolicy

To set the record straight Authentication answers to the **Who** can access questions and Authorization answers to the **What** can you do once you gain access, So in general authorization brings along a set of permissions and actions.
In our context, We will enforce access rules through Istio policy and make sure that only specific services can perform specific actions. 

![Authorization Policy Overview](https://ahmedkhamessi.com/img/servicemesh/authorization/overview.png)

A couple of facts around authorization in Istio
- Authorization policy supports both allow and deny policies.
- The deny policies are evaluated first.
- The scope is determined by "metadata/namespace" and to further restrict "selector" can be used.
- Authorization policy is decoupled from the authentication mechanism.

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: rev-authz
  namespace: default  #Apply to default namespace
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: reviews
  rules:  # [default] If no rules then deny all
  - from:
    - source:
        principals: ["cluster.local/ns/default/sa/bookinfo-productpage"]  #Allow req from this service account 
    to:
    - operation:
        methods: ["GET"]  #Allow Get
```
## Architecture Refinement

![Application Architeciture](https://ahmedkhamessi.com/img/servicemesh/authorization/application_architecture.png)

Although mTLS is configured and the connection between the **details** and the **reviews** is secured, the service is not able/allowed to send requests over because of the **AuthorizationPolicy**.
